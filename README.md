## Day One: What is Cloud Computing

### 001 Traditional IT Overview

**Purpose of Section**: Introduces the basics of the Cloud and Cloud Computing. This section is theory-focused with minimal hands-on activities.

**Goal**: Provide context for understanding the usefulness of the Cloud and how it works.

#### Basics of How Websites Work:

- **Client-Server Model**:
  - Websites are hosted on servers.
  - Clients (browsers) connect to servers via a network to access websites.
  
- **Process**:
  1. Client sends a request through the network to the server.
  2. The server processes the request and sends back a response.
  
- **Role of IP Addresses**:
  - Both client and server need IP addresses for communication.
  - **Analogy**: Comparable to sending a letter:
    - The client writes a request (letter) and uses the network (post office) to send it to the server.
    - Server responds using the clientâ€™s return address.

#### Anatomy of a Server:

- **Key Components**:
  - **CPU**: Performs computations and calculations.
  - **RAM**: Fast memory for quick data storage and retrieval.
  - **Storage**: Long-term data storage (e.g., files, databases).
  - **Database**: Stores structured data for easy searching and querying.
  - **Networking**: Includes routers, switches, and DNS servers.
  
- **Analogy**:
  - **CPU + RAM = Brain**:
    - CPU handles computations (thinking).
    - RAM stores short-term memory.
    - Storage acts like long-term memory.

#### IT Terminology:

- **Network**: Composed of cables, routers, and servers interconnected.
- **Router**: Routes data packets between devices in a network, like a post office directing mail.
- **Switch**: Delivers data packets to the correct device within a local network.

#### Traditional IT Setup:

- **Before the Cloud**:
  - Companies hosted websites on physical servers purchased and set up locally (e.g., in garages).
  - Infrastructure was managed entirely in-house, requiring significant effort and resources.

### 002 What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing provides access to computing resources over the internet. Instead of owning physical hardware, you rent resources like storage, computing power, and networking from cloud providers, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

#### Key Features of Cloud Computing:

- **On-Demand**: Resources are provided as needed.
- **Pay-As-You-Go Pricing**: Pay only for what you use, and stop paying when you no longer need it.

#### Key Benefits:

1. **Flexibility**:
   - Adjust resource size and type based on needs.
   - Example: Provision 1 or 10 servers as required, scaling up or down instantly.
   
2. **Instant Access**:
   - Resources like servers are provisioned within seconds without advance notice.
   
3. **Ease of Use**:
   - Intuitive interfaces enable access to servers, storage, databases, and application services.
   
4. **Managed Hardware**:
   - Cloud providers like AWS handle the infrastructure, while users focus on provisioning and usage.

#### Comparison to Traditional IT:

- Traditional IT required setting up and maintaining physical data centers.
- Cloud computing replaces this with shared data centers managed by providers, allowing users to focus solely on their applications.

#### Everyday Use Cases:

- **Gmail**: A cloud-based email service where you use storage without provisioning servers.
- **Cloud Storage Services**: 
  - Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud (Dropbox was originally built on AWS).
- **Streaming Services**:
  - Netflix runs entirely on AWS, offering on-demand video streaming.

#### Types of Clouds:

1. **Private Cloud**:
   - Dedicated cloud services for a single organization.
   - Managed by a third party but not shared with others.
   - Offers better security for sensitive applications.
   
2. **Public Cloud**:
   - Services are shared and accessible over the Internet.
   - Examples: AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud.
   - Ideal for scalability and flexibility.
   
3. **Hybrid Cloud**:
   - A mix of private and public clouds.
   - Combines on-premises resources with cloud infrastructure.
   - Balances control of sensitive data with cost efficiency.

#### Characteristics of Cloud Computing:

- **On-Demand Self-Service**: Users can provision resources as needed.
- **Resource Pooling**: Providers manage pooled resources shared across multiple clients.
- **Rapid Elasticity**: Scale resources up or down quickly to match demand.
- **Measured Service**: Resource usage is monitored, controlled, and billed based on consumption.
- **Broad Network Access**: Access resources over the Internet from various devices.

#### Advantages of Cloud Computing:

- **On-Demand Access**: Resources like servers, databases, and networking can be provisioned as needed.
- **Scalability**: Ensures efficient use of resources by scaling services up or down.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go pricing eliminates large upfront investments in hardware.
- **Global Reach**: Data centers worldwide ensure low-latency access and high availability.
- **Reliability**: Built-in disaster recovery and high availability mechanisms.
- **Security**: Leading providers implement robust security measures.

#### Problems Cloud Computing Solves:

- High capital costs, complex infrastructure management, limited scalability, geographical constraints, disaster recovery, and barriers to innovation.

### 003 The Different Types of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing can be categorized into three main types, each offering different levels of management and responsibility. These are **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**, **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**, and **Software as a Service (SaaS)**.

#### 1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- **Definition**: Provides foundational building blocks for IT infrastructure.
- **Components**: Includes raw computing resources like networking, data storage, and virtual machines.
- **Flexibility**: Similar to building with LEGO blocks, allowing users to create custom IT environments.
- **Responsibilities**: Users manage:
  - Application
  - Data
  - Runtime
  - Middleware
  - Operating System  
  Providers manage:
  - Virtualization
  - Servers
  - Storage
  - Networking  
- **Examples**: Amazon EC2, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Rackspace, DigitalOcean, Linode.

#### 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- **Definition**: Removes the need to manage the underlying infrastructure.
- **Focus**: Enables users to focus on application deployment and management.
- **Responsibilities**: Providers manage:
  - Infrastructure
  - Operating System
  - Middleware
  - Networking  
  Users manage:
  - Applications
  - Data  
- **Examples**: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Google App Engine, Windows Azure.

#### 3. Software as a Service (SaaS)
- **Definition**: Fully managed service where the provider manages both the application and infrastructure.
- **Usage**: Users access a complete product through a web interface without maintenance or updates.
- **Responsibilities**: Providers manage:
  - Infrastructure
  - Platform
  - Software  
  Users interact with:
  - The software application  
- **Examples**: AWS Rekognition, Google Apps (e.g., Gmail, Google Drive), Dropbox, Zoom.

#### Cloud Pricing Models

**Pay-As-You-Go:**  

AWS offers a pay-as-you-go model based on three pricing fundamentals:  

- **Compute:** Pay for the exact compute time used.  
- **Storage:** Pay for the amount of data stored.  
- **Networking:** Pay only when data leaves the cloud (data entering the cloud is free).  

**Benefits:**  

This model reduces the need for costly investments in physical IT infrastructure, allowing for significant cost savings. Organizations pay only for what they actually need, avoiding over-provisioning and unused resources.
