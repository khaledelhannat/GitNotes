# Knowledge Repository

Welcome to my Knowledge Repository! This is where I organize, track, and document my learning journey. The repository is structured to help me maintain notes, explore courses, and track progress efficiently using Git.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is divided into branches and folders for easy navigation and organization:

### **Main Branch**
This branch serves as an index and overview of the entire repository. It includes:
- General guidelines
- Table of contents
- Links to other branches and topics

### **Branches**
Each branch focuses on a specific topic, course, or area of interest. Examples include:
- `personal-notes`: My personal reflections and insights.
- `course-[course-name]`: Notes and resources from individual courses.
- `projects`: Projects and experiments I've worked on.
